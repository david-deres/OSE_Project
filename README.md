# Welcome to David and Niv's OSE_Project

Link to the final project visualization I made:

https://www.mathcha.io/editor/VVPNEILvCjWCl4XBJyIp3eJDph6G5WzNtOl4OJZ

There, I explain about how we've implemented a Network card driver that doesn't have packet copying overhead, 
by wisely using address space mapping.
In addition, there is a diagram overviewing a Chat server we have implemented.

You can also find a written explanation under the chatroom branch -> answers-lab6.txt

Enjoy! :)
