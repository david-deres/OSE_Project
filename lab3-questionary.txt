=== This template file contains questions you need to answer.
=== Fill your answers on appropriate blank lines only.
=== Don't start any line with three equal signs "===".
=== Don't edit any lines starting from three equal signs.
=== Use C notation to write numbers: 42 for decimal, 0x2a for hexadecimal.
=== We may check most of the answers automatically, so "forty two" or
=== "26+16" won't work for this example. Spaces are mostly ignored, so
=== "  42  " is OK (without quotes of course). 
=== When asked to specify address & instruction, do it in the form of
=== gdb output "ADDRESS: INSTRUCTION", for example "0x7c26:  or  $0x1,%eax"
=== Don't make lines longer than 80 characters. You don't need to fit your
=== answer in a single line, you can start a new line at will.
=== However, when asked to fill "a table" make each table raw a single line.

=== Q In Exercise 4, can the function 'trap' ever return?
===   (yes/no)
yes

=== Q What is the purpose of having an individual handler function for
===   each exception/interrupt? (i.e., if all exceptions/interrupts
===   were delivered to the same handler, what feature that exists in
===   the current implementation could not be provided?)
===   (free form, 1 sentence)
provide the ability to distinguish between interrupts with error codes
to ones where an error code is not pushed onto the stack.

=== Q Did you have to do anything to make the user/softint program
===   behave correctly?
===   (yes/no)
yes

=== Q The grade script expects it to produce a general protection
===   fault (trap 13), but softint's code says int $14. Why should
===   this produce interrupt vector 13? 
===   (free form, 1 sentence)
INT requires that CPL<=DPL before executing an interrupt,
but softint is run in user mode where CPL==3, despite DPL==0 for trap 14,
so the proccessor produces trap 13 in response to illigal INT execution.

TODO: verify that by setting dpl as 3, the softint test fails

=== Q What happens if the kernel actually allows softint's int $14
===   instruction to invoke the kernel's page fault handler (which is
===   interrupt vector 14)?
===   (free form, 1 sentence)
INT doesn't store an error code on the kernel stack, or sets CR2 register,
which the page fault handlers expects to include informations about the fault,
so the handler will handle a page fault based on arbitrary values.

=== Q The break point test case will either generate a break point
===   exception or a general protection fault depending on how you
===   initialized the break point entry in the IDT (i.e., your call to
===   SETGATE from idt_init). Why? How did you need to set it in
===   order to  get the breakpoint exception to work as specified
===   above and what incorrect setup would cause it to trigger a
===   general protection fault?
===   (free form)
the breakpoint test attempts to generate a breakpoint exception with INT 3
before generating an interrupt, INT checks if the CPL<=DPL for that interrupt.
so to get the exception to work, the last argument of SETGATE,
which sets the DPL for that interrupt, must be 3,
which is the CPL of the test since it is executed in user mode.
otherwise, proccessor produces a general protection fault,
in response to illigal INT execution.

TODO: verify that without DPL==3 the breakpoint test fails

=== Q What do you think is the point of these mechanisms, particularly
===   in light of what the user/softint test program does? 
===   (free form, 1 sentence)

=== Q In Exercise 9, what causes the page fault which panics the
===   kernel when running user/breakpoint?
===   (free form, 1 sentence)

====================================================================
=== Q What challenge(s) have you chosen to implement? (specify
===   challenge numbers separated by spaces, if more than one)

=== Q If the challenge requires changing the kernel source, list the
===   files which you have changed/added during implementation.
===   (one file per line, relative to lab directory containing .git/)

=== Q Describe you solution.
===   (free form, up to 500 words, don't need to use all 500!)
